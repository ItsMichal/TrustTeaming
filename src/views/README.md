# Views

This folder contains the logic for the various views in the app. It receives
data from a place in `/cores`, and then uses that data to usually render a
template found in `/templates`, with sometime doing advanced logic.

## NOTE

These are mostly boilerplate and are not used. They are similar to a traditional
flask app structure, and are perfect for rendering your static pages. However, a
lot of this testbed is dynamic, so this section is not used as much as
`webScripts` and the `cores`
