# Trust Teaming Base Folder

-   Contains `DataManager.py`, which singlehandedly manages connections and
    usage of the Redis DB and ORM. Providing a Facade/Adapter for it. Might move
    into its own folder just in case later- as with all other major sections

-   `app.py` is the default starting point.

-   `TrustTeaming.py` is the master controller for the logic
